How to set up GLFW on Mac (instructions from http://jonbho.net/2013/08/24/one-week-game-getting-ready/):

GLFW library: you need to install the GLFW library, which is one of the best ways to do OpenGL apps on OS X nowadays without using Objective C. It has to be installed from source. We are going to use version 2.7.9, to totally avoid pointers (not doable with GLFW 3.0). Download glfw-2.7.9.zip from http://sourceforge.net/projects/glfw/files/glfw/2.7.9/. Uncompress it in some temporary place, go there with the shell, and type “make cocoa”, then “sudo make cocoa-install”. [NOTE: A reader over at Reddit suggests that if you're using Hombrew, typing "brew install glfw" will do the whole thing. Haven't tried, but it looks like it should work, and it's GLFW 2.7.7, which is fine. Good luck!].
