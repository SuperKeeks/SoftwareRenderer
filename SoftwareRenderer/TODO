-Implement better triangle rasterization (read https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/triangle-rasterization-in-practice/)
-Triangle strip with indices
-Improve performance by interpolating texcoords, colors and z by calculating the values of them at the edges and then getting deltas to add as we paint a line (inspired by http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/articles/article331.html)

-Move drawTriangleFaster, drawTriangleSlow and drawTriangleWireframe into "xxxRasterizer" classes. Allow channging during exection
-Reduce vertex (or vectors of vertices) copies when passing to functions, etc. Try making draw*() functions receive a const ref to the vector instead of copies
