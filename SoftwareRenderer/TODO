Short term
==========
-Refactor main, better handling of model transforms
-Fix issues with "faster" rasterizer
-Add animation support for MD2 models

Long term
=========
-Implement better triangle rasterization (read https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/triangle-rasterization-in-practice/)
-Triangle strip with indices
-Improve performance by interpolating texcoords, colors and z by calculating the values of them at the edges and then getting deltas to add as we paint a line (inspired by http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/articles/article331.html)
